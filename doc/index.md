Title: MfGames Writing
---
MfGames Writing is a collection of tools (command-line programs) for writers to use text files in the story and novel writing process. It is centered around an easily accessible file format (a basic text file with markup) and managing those files (typically through source control).

Working with these tools isn't as easy as just opening up Microsoft Word or Libreoffice and writing. There are additional steps to do, both setting up the environment and also creating the output files. This can be overwhelming, more so the first time you do it.

Likewise, these tools interact with a number of other programs. This was intentional and hopefully how to get things working will be properly illustrated here. If you have questions, feel free to ask in the forums.
