Title: Justification
---
Working on a project like this takes time and energy. If someone else has created a different project that does the same thing, it is better to join efforts or contribute to that project instead of creating a brand new one.

One way of determing that is to actually do some web searches and investigate other projects. This page describes what programs compete with this project and why we didn't just help those projects.

# Microsoft Word, OpenOffice.org, Libreoffice

All three of these are word processors that work well with writing. They have spell-checkers, auto-corect, and a whole slew of functions to make it easier to write.

* Binary Files: The output file for all of them is a binary file. This makes it difficult to work with a source control system while using deltas.
* Corruptions: While file corruptions are less of an occurance as they were in the past, it is possible to lose the contents of the file.  With the Zip/XML file formats, this is less of an issue, but it does require a fair amount of effort to recover if it does happen.
* Cross-Platform: Microsoft Word does not work outside of the Windows environments. Both OpenOffice.org and Libreoffice trailed in the Mac environments for a number of years.

It isn't to say these applications aren't good for writing. Far from that, but they don't fit with the [goals](purpose) of this project.
