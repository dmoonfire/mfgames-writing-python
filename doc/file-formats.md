Title: File Formats
---
This library is designed to work around and with a number of file formats. As the [goals](purpose) indicate, the system works around text files that are easily source controllable but still provide the ability to integrate with other formats.

* [Creole](http://www.wikicreole.org/wiki/Creole1.0): Creole is a text-based format that was originally designed to be a generic markup that could be shared across different Wiki implementations.

* [DocBook 5](http://www.docbook.org/tdg5/en/html/docbook.html): DocBook 5 is an XML-based implementation of DocBook. The DocBook schema has a large number of features that are appropriate for most short stories and novels. In addition, there are a number of tools to convert DocBook into other formats such as Microsoft Word, RTF, or PDF.

* [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/): Markdown is a low-overhead text format that can be edited with a text editor and includes minor formatting rules such as bold, italics, and blockquotes. There are two ways of including metadata into Markdown and both are described on the appropriate page.

* Rich Text Format (a.k.a. RTF): Is a common format that can be opened by most word processors.
