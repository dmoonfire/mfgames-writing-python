Title: Text Editors
---
When working with Creole and Markdown files, any text editor will do. Notepad.exe has everything you need to write out words, but many editors provide additional features which make the writing process a bit more comfortable.

Here are some of the editors you can use for writing files along with a few notes or suggestions on how to make them even better for writing.

# General Editors

* [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) (Windows, Mac, Linux; OSS): Emacs is a dinosaur when it comes to editing environments but it also has a large number of features such as on-the-fly spelling and auto-correct. And, since it pretty much predate the mouse, it is great for touch-typists; however the keyboard shortcuts are not intuitive for those who prefer [IBM CUA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Common_User_Access).

  We have a few [tricks and tips](emacs) while working with Emacs for writing.

* [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Windows)

# Markdown Editors

* (Win) [MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com/): Since we usually focus on the words, the dynamic output of the Markdown output isn't as useful. However, if you use a large number of italics, bold, or blockquotes, it might be helpful to see them formatted.
